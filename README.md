# 🔪 Slice_And_Dice

**Slice_And_Dice** is a fast‑paced, hyper‑casual slicing game inspired by “Fruit Ninja.” Swipe to pop objects before they fall—avoid misses and bombs!

---

## 🎯 Game Concept

- Objects (fruits, shapes, etc.) spawn from top and fall downward.  
- Swipe (touch/mouse) to slice and destroy them.  
- If **3 objects** reach the bottom un‑sliced, the game ends.  
- Beware of **bombs**—slicing a bomb deducts points!
